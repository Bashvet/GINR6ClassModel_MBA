# GINR6ClassModel_MBA
An individual-based, mechanistic-stochastic simulation model implemented in R to simulate Haemonchus contortus dynamics in sheep populations
The model integrates Parasite life cycle (L3 ingestion → L4 establishment → adult worms → egg output), Host immune responses (IgA-mediated suppression of fecundity, ECF-driven establishment control), Environmental feedback (pasture contamination, free-living larval survival), and Management interventions (anthelmintic treatments with partial efficacy and coverage).
The model is implemented using the R6 class system in R version 4.4.1 (R Core Team, 2024), which enables object-oriented encapsulation of state variables and behavioral methods for each simulation component.
